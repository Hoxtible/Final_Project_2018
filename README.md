Intro to CS: Python	April 20, 2018

Final project

(For an example of this form to model from, look at [https://goo.gl/T4bvjJ](https://goo.gl/T4bvjJ))

**Project Name:**

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Asteroid Explorer</td>
  </tr>
</table>


**Description:**

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>You have an Asteroids style ship and are flying through the universe. Your goal is to land on as many asteroids and planets as possible without crashing or running out of fuel. You can refuel on the planets. There are randomly generated asteroids and planets you can explore. +10 points for landing on a planet, +3 points per asteroid (these may change).</td>
  </tr>
</table>


**Controls - **

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>W flies forward. A and D turn.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


**Types of things we will see (which require classes to be written):**

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Player, Planet, Asteroid</td>
  </tr>
</table>


**Things that will require lists**

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Planets
Asteroids</td>
  </tr>
</table>


**Interactions**

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Player landing on asteroid
Player crashing into asteroid
Player entering asteroid gravity
Player landing on planet
Player crashing into planet
Player entering planet gravity
Player refueling on planet</td>
  </tr>
</table>


**Game modes**

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>title screen, main game, game over</td>
  </tr>
</table>


**Sounds**

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>engine firing, player crashing, player landing</td>
  </tr>
</table>


**Timeline - in what order do we want to add things to our game? The goal is to get each thing working properly before we move onto the next thing. We want to get the game "playable" as soon as possible. (That means to make the game runnable and let the player do something.) And we want to be able to make the game playable as often as possible - so we don't want to add a step that breaks the program for several steps. **

**We do this for a few reasons - to make sure that things work early on, to make sure the game is going to be fun, and so that if we run out of time (which is likely) that we have a playable game to turn in. **
